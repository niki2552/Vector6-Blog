        <h1>Shoulder Workouts For Men</h1>
        <p>
            No two people work out exactly the same. Whether it's choice and sequence
            of exercises, how many sets to complete of each move, how heavy to go
            and reps completed, length of rest periods, or advanced training techniques and finishing moves,
            each lifter has his or her own workout DNA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the 9.5 million users of BodySpace, there are probably 9.5 million
            different shoulder workouts. Individuality can be a good thing, but certain principles
            make some routines better than others, especially for specific goals. So rather than present
            you with 9.5 million ways to train your delts—which would
            make this article slightly time-consuming to read—I've whittled it down to seven really great
            ones, each with a unique training goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay especially close attention to how exercise choice and order, weight/rep targets, volume,
            and advanced-training principles can be manipulated to fine-tune a routine
            for a specific goal. If you find one you like, try it for 4-8 weeks, then go back to your regular
            workout or try another from the list.

        <h3>Workout Notes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>These workouts don't include warm-up sets. Do as many as you need,
                but never take warm-ups to muscle
                failure.
            </li>
            <li>Choose a weight that allows you to reach muscle failure by the target-rep listed.</li>
            <li>If you have a spotter, do a few forced reps on your heaviest sets of overhead presses.
                If you don't have a partner, do a dropset on your last set of each exercise,
                reducing the weight by about 25 percent when you reach muscle failure and continuing
                on to a second point of muscle failure.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Goal Overall Delt Mass</h3>
        <p>
            To build mass, always start your workout with the most demanding exercises—multijoint
            overhead presses, in the case of the delts—which allow you to push the most weight.
            In this mass workout, a second multijoint move is next, followed by single-joint moves for each of
            the three delts heads: front,
            iddle, and rear. This is the foundation for a solid mass workout. Keeping the total volume
            fairly high also promotes muscle growth.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can make the workout more challenging in several ways.
            For the overhead press, start by using dumbbells, which are slightly more difficult t
            o control and have a slightly longer range of motion than a barbell. We'll also follow a
            reverse-pyramid scheme, which allows you to take more total sets to muscle failure. For the first
            2 sets, you'll use a fairly heavy weight for a low rep target—just 6—to promote even greater
            gains than you might normally get when shooting for a slightly higher rep target. As you become
            increasingly
            fatigued, decrease the weight by about 5 pounds per side on subsequent sets.
            Finally, on your two heaviest sets, enlist a spotter who can provide you just enough h
            elp to keep the weight moving.
        </p>
        <img src="../BodyWorkouts/overal-delt-mass.jpg" alt="shoulders-workouts">
        <p>
            Because the front delts get so much work on chest day, and the middle delts take the
            brunt of the weight on overhead pressing moves, it's not uncommon for the rear delts to
            be the smallest—and weakest—of the three. In this workout, you'll do them before the other two,
            while you have a bit more energy in the tank. Feel free to rearrange the order of the single-joint
            moves based on your weaknesses, though.
            If you judge your delts to be fairly balanced, simply rotate the order of the single-joint movements
            from one workout to the next.
        </p>

        <h3>Goal Greater Delt Definition</h3>
        <p>
            Lifting light weights for high reps is no longer considered the best approach to
            better defining the deltoids. This workout focuses on a stimulus to boost size first
            (moderate weight for moderate reps), then a high volume of work combined with supersets
            to increase the number of calories burned both during
            the workout and after (called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, or EPOC).
            You'll be moving faster and really feeling the muscle burn.

        <h3>Goal Building A Foundation</h3>
        <p>
            This basic routine consists of an overhead press
            plus a single-joint move for each of the three delt heads. When possible,
            start with machines to learn the feel of the
            motion before graduating to free weights. So long as you adjust the machine for your body
            mechanics, you're constrained to the proper motion.
        </p>
        <img src="../BodyWorkouts/goal-buildin-foudation.jpg" alt="workout-shoulders">
        <p>
            Though jumping over to free weights will prove to be a
            challenge for your coordination initially, they're better
            for muscle-building in the long term. Start light to
            focus on proper form first. Add weight only when you can fully control the motion.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Goal Middle-Delt Growth</h3>
        <p>
            Making your shoulders appear wider requires emphasizing the middle delts. Doing so
            helps broaden your V-taper
            while creating the illusion of a smaller waist.
            The key to the workout, of course, is to do more movements that target the middle delts.
        </p>
        <img src="../BodyWorkouts/middle-delt.jpg" alt="workout-shoulders">
        <p>
            Besides additional exercises, you'll want to use slightly different angles for a slightly different
            training stimulus, and do middle-delt exercises earlier in your routine, when your
            strength levels are highest. You can alternate this routine with a more balanced delt workout
            (such as the mass workout) in your weekly split.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Goal Rear-Delt Growth</h3>
        <p>
            Rear delts are commonly lagging for novices and bodybuilding pros alike. Simply put,
            they don't get as much stimulation, given that the front and middle delts are involved in
            chest- and shoulder-pressing moves. While the rears are called into action on back day, all
            too many lifters focus on mirror muscles.
        </p>
        <img src="../BodyWorkouts/rear-delt-grow.jpg" alt="workout-shoulders">
        <p>
            f your rears are in arrears, just follow this routine for 4-8 weeks—or alternate with
            a more balanced shoulder routine—to help bring them up.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Even though you'll be stronger with the single-joint exercises because you're
            doing them first, avoid the temptation to go too heavy, because of the added stress to your elbows joints.
            Also, because you're already highly fatigued by the time you get to your presses,
            a machine version might be a bit safer.</p>
